## Node JS internals Overview:
 - Node.JS is a library or a framework that's written in 50% JS and 50% C++.
 - It relies on two other frameworks, namely, V8, and Libuv.
 - V8 main functionality is to interpret the JS code we write and execte it, meanwhile libuv main functionality is to give nodejs access to the underlying operating system networking, concurrency, and filesystem.

 - Nodejs main purpose is to give us a consistent interface to underlying libraries functionality by implementing some modules.

## Example of how a Nodejs builtin Function works:

  - Let's have a look at `pbkdf2()` that's just an algorithm for hashing passwords with adding salt to it.
  - Go to https://www.github.com/nodejs/node , and there we only care about two folders, the `lib` and `src` folders -> Lib contains the JS definitions of the builtin functions and src contains the C++ impl (where libuv and v8 are used).
  - In lib/internal/crypto, we can find pbkdf2.js file. One important line is where `PBKDF2()` gets called, this is the C++ impl. and it is imported from this line `process.binding('crypto')`.

  - navigating to src/node_crypto.cc we will find a 5k+ lines file that conatins all crypto functionality that Node relies on.
  - Scrolling to the bottom of the file, we can see the methods being exported into env and that what links them to JS world (process.binding).
  - looking closely to this file, we will find al ot of `using v8::<TYPE>` and this is basically importing the C++ equivalent of JS TYPEs that is being used in our JS code.
  - Libuv also is used in this file for concurrency work.
